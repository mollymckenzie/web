# DecapCMS Implementation Plan

This project now includes a DecapCMS starter at `public/admin` for Netlify deployment.

## Why this setup

Based on DecapCMS docs, the minimum static-site integration is:
- `admin/index.html` loading DecapCMS from CDN
- `admin/config.yml` defining backend and content collections

DecapCMS works with or without Netlify, but on Netlify the typical path is `git-gateway` + Netlify Identity for authentication.

## What is added

- `public/admin/index.html`
- `public/admin/config.yml`
- `local_backend: true` enabled for local editing workflow

## Netlify steps

1. In Netlify site settings, enable **Identity**.
2. Under Identity, enable **Git Gateway**.
3. Invite content editors (or enable registration based on policy).
4. Deploy and open `/web/admin/`.

## Local editing flow

1. Start Astro dev server.
2. In a second terminal, run:
   - `npx decap-server`
3. Open `http://localhost:4321/web/admin/`.

`local_backend` is for local development only.

## Notes for this repo

- Content maps to `src/content/complete-catalog`.
- New metadata fields are included for role-aware views:
  - `dataThemes`
  - `pedagogicalTags`
  - `audienceAccess`
  - `sensitive`
- Teacher view can include pedagogical tags; student/community views are theme-only and filtered.
